#Bongo-boy the Guitar Hero drum to MIDI converter.

# Introduction #

BongoBoy is a simple Arduino project that translates from the Wii Guitar Hero World Tour drum set to MIDI without using any external hardware or modifying the drum set in any way.


# Details #

Using just two cables and a resistor we can read out the data provided by the drum pads, including velocity data, convert it to MIDI and send it on to your keyboard or other MIDI device.  This is a simple way to convert your Guitar Hero drums to something that aproximates a real drum set reasonably well.
